# Internship2A

This directory contains the essential codes developed during my 2nd year internship in engineering school. 

The DataSet is just one example of a dataset using point cloud data. It can be viewed by MatLab scripts in order to see what it looks like.



All codes and data are available to the University of MÃ¤lardalens
